# **Cloud & DevOps Learning Journey**  

### **Current Focus**  
Final-year BCA student building expertise in cloud-native technologies through hands-on practice.  

### **Learning Path**  
- **Languages:** Golang (primary), C/C++ (prior experience)  
- **Platforms:** Linux (Ubuntu), Virtualization (VirtualBox)  
- **Core Stack:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Networking  
- **Method:** Project-based learning + open-source contributions  


### **Why This Approach?**  
- Cloud-native tools demand **practical fluency**, not just theoretical knowledge.  
- Open-source contributions force **real-world problem-solving**.  
- Public documentation holds me accountable and helps others.  🧠 Topics Covered (Ongoing)

✅ Golang basics & concurrency

✅ Git workflows & version control

✅ Linux internals (bash, permissions, processes)

✅ Docker (containerization, images, volumes)

✅ Kubernetes (orchestration with Minikube/Kind)

✅ Networking (OSI/TCP-IP, ports, tools)
